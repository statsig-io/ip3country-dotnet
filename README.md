# ip3country-dotnet

A zero-dependency, super small, IP address to 2-letter [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) lookup library. There are already several libraries available, but none met our requirements for binary size and lookup speed.

This project in its entirety is <500KB, compared to most alternatives out there that are north of 40MB (but might provide more than just countries).

The database used in this project is compacted from [IP2Location](https://lite.ip2location.com/database/ip-country). Their DB1.LITE edition is provided under CCA, with the attribution below:

## Usage


```cs
using IP3Country;

// Lookup using ip4 str
var country = CountryLookup.LookupIPStr("123.45.67.8"); // => 'KR'

// Lookup using numeric ip
country = CountryLookup.LookupIPNumber(2066563848); // => 'KR'
```

## Accuracy

`ip3country`'s accuracy is dependent on IP2Location LITE's accuracy. In our experience, for country lookups, it is accurate enough for most applications.

IP2Location publishes accuracy reports here: https://www.ip2location.com/data-accuracy

There's also this third party report available: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nz247/publications/JSAC2011-Geolocation.pdf

## Name

All variants of "ip2country" were already taken in npm, so we decided to step it up.

## Motivation

At [Statsig](https://www.statsig.com), we needed a library to evaluate location-based conditions on Feature Gates (Feature Flags).  We use ip3country to power country-level rollouts or A/B tests for new features.
